I'm pretty new to github so please excuse me, I could not find an easier way to coment on your Problem.

I'm by no way one of the Nuberphile guys, but I`ll give IT my best shot.

When I was looking at your solution, a pattern emerged.
Start with 4 and multiply as long as possible with 4,
then when you "Hit" 16 go to 1 and so on.
This pattern will give the best solution until now.
I was interested in if there is a better pattern with other nubers.

I got to this formula:

n^(15-(n-1)) /(n-1)!

This will give you the best result with the pattern you used. 
With 4 it is:

4^12 /6

Or

4*4*4/1*4*4*4/2*4*4*4/3*4*4*4

This syncs up perfectly with the best found pattern.

If you analyse the formula,
you can proof that n=4 is by far the best solution,
as long as you only use whole nubers. 
Because the faculty part of the formula grows way more rapid than the exponential part. 
You can show that the Funktion is rather nice between n=1 and n=14. 
This funktion needs to have at least on maximum(or minimum) and you can show it is between n=3 and n=5

So as long as there is no improved pattern,
this is the best solution.
