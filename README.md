# [Request for help] 3D Billiards Pool: Matrix Mode Solution Proof

[View Source Code on Github](https://github.com/jakedowns/matrix-mode-sequence-finder)

Eivaa Games' [Pool Billiards 3D](https://www.eivaagames.com/games/pool-billiards-3d/) has this unique *Matrix* mode. It's has a "correct solution" to get the highest score possible. but when I set about finding it, I ran into some interesting challenges. I'm wondering if any math wizards out there can devise a way of PROVING what the BEST sequence of 1-15 is to achieve the highest possible score in this mode. The way the mode is scored is as follows:

> Rules: "In Matrix Mode, when you pocket a ball your score will be multiplied by the difference of your previous and current ball number if the current is more than the previous; but if the current is less, then your score is divided by the current ball number."

One interesting side-effect of this scoring method is that if you pocket the balls in sequence 1,2,3...15 your final score will be **1**.

I set about solving shorter sequences as an exercise and I was able to brute-force check & score each possible permutation for seq. length 2-11 to find the highest scoring sequences:

```
 2: 2,1: 2
 3: 2,1,3: 4
 4: 2,4,1,3: 8
 5: 3,2,5,1,4: 18
 6: 3,6,2,5,1,4: 45
 7: 3,6,2,5,1,4,7: 135
 8: 3,6,2,5,8,1,4,7: 405
 9: 3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7: 1134
10: 3,6,9,2,5,8,1,4,7,10: 3402
11: 4,8,2,6,10,3,7,11,1,5,9: 11008
```

However, I began to hit memory limits and my naive first-pass Javascript code would need some performance tuning to be able to brute-force check 12-15. Plus, I don't know how long it would take my laptop to check 15^15 solutions (I'm sure I could estimate this)

Examining the shorter sequences, I wasn't able to identify any simple pattern for "dealing" out the numbers in sequence. Only pattern I noticed was the starting numbers of 2(x3),3(x6),4(x?) which means the best scoring sequence for 12-15 is _likely_ to start with a 4, maybe followed by an 8. but i'd like to **prove** that.

**X-Axis**: sequence length, **Y-Axis**: ball number, each cell is the slot # or "position" of each Y-axis ball number in the corresponding "best" sequence for each sequence length.

My best attempt at solving this so far has been a semi-random-weighted search. The method I'm currently using is as follows:

1. Randomly shuffle numbers
1. Score the sequence
1. Shuffle again, and compare score to previous "top score"
1. If a random sequence beats the previous "top score" increase the IdealNumbersForSlots hashmap of weights for each slot:# combination
1. During the next shuffling of numbers theres a (configurable) 50/50 probability that the seq will be random OR use the Weights hashmap to build a weighted array (for each slot) from which a number will be picked until the pool of 1-15 is exhausted
1. Score, Check, Repeat.

The top score I've been able to acheive so far with this method is `2,797,568` using the sequence: `4,8,12,2,6,10,14,3,7,11,15,1,5,9,13` my score prediction was a little off; it lead to a final in-game score of `2,793,472`

Unfortunately there's no global leader board in the game for this mode, so I'm not sure if that's the best sequence, or if there's still a better one out there. ðŸ¤©

Here's some other methods I'd like to attempt for solving this riddle:
1. Performance optimized Multi-threaded Brute Force (GPU assisted?)
2. Machine Learning / Neural Network Approach?

My Scoring Function:

```
let scoreSequence = function(seq){
  let final = -1;
  let prev = -1;
  seq.map((ball)=>{
    if(final === -1){
      final = ball;
    }else{
      if(ball > prev){
        final *= (ball - prev);
      }else{
        final = Math.round(final / ball); // maybe they use floor or ceil here?
        if(final < 0){ final = 0; }
      }
    }
    //console.log(ball, prev, final);
    prev = ball;
  });
  return final;
}
```
